# Description  
This repository contains code for SieGra SieMa website and database. 

# How to
## Commits
Link all commits with at least one issue or pull request.  
Example: 
>git commit -m *This commit will* #1 add readme file  

***Italic should be ignored in commit message***  
You should only add files **you know** you have changed. 
To close the issue in commit use:
>git commit -m *This commit will* **fix** #1 add readme file  

## Pull requests
Never merge to either main branch without getting a positive review before. Keep it simple and clean. All merged changes should be checked for errors before pushing to main branch.  

## Issues
Remember to use proper labels and milestones. It helps everyone be organised. Keep title simple and elaborate in description. Try to keep issues relatively small instead.
If one issue can be divided into multiple separate, do it.

## Branches
Always try to keep the branch as updated as it needs to be. Try to create branches from main and keep the tree relevant.
